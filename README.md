### About Me

My name is Malcolm Bowles, and I am a PhD student in [Mathematics](http://www.math.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca). My two supervisors are:

* [*Nassif Ghoussoub*](http://www.birs.ca/~nassif/)
* [*Young-Heon Kim*](http://www.math.ubc.ca/~yhkim/)

My research is concerned with an area called optimal transportation ~~which will make your commute faster~~ . Roughly speaking, optimal transportation is the study of a class of optimisation problems where we wish to take "mass" from one place and distribute it to another, in the most "cost effective" way. It turns out that this problem has many interesting structures which have application to other areas of mathematics.

A favourite quote of mine is by [*Bernt Ã˜ksendal*](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540047582), which perhaps summarises the academic journey so far:

>We have not succeeded in answering all our problems. The answers we have found only serve to raise a whole set of new questions. In some ways we feel we are as confused as ever, but we believe we are confused on a higher level and about more important things.

Often in mathematics you will see common phrases appearing again and again. Below I have listed some common remarks, and their literal translations

*"Easy to see"* | **It will take several hours to figure it out **
