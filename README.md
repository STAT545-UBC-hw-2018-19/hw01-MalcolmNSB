### About Me

My name is Malcolm Bowles, and I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca). 

One of my favourite quotes about mathematics is by [**Bernt Ã˜ksendal**](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540047582):

>We have not succeeded in answering all our problems. The answers we have found only serve to raise a whole set of new questions. In some ways we feel we are as confused as ever, but we believe we are confused on a higher level and about more important things.
